# DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning and Hybrid Feature Selection (HFSA)

## üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks in IoT environments using various **Machine Learning (ML)** models. The objective is to build a highly accurate system capable of classifying multiple types of attacks efficiently.

We began with **46 features** from the dataset. To enhance performance and reduce complexity, we applied a **Hybrid Feature Selection Approach (HFSA)** ‚Äî a combination of **Random Forest** and **Chi-Square** feature ranking ‚Äî and selected the top **20 most relevant features**. This significantly improved model performance.

## üöÄ Key Highlights

- **ML Algorithms Used**:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
  - **Random Forest (RF)**
  - **XGBoost**
  - **Decision Tree**

- **Feature Selection**:
  - Started with all **46 features**
  - Applied **HFSA (Random Forest + Chi-Square)**
  - Best results obtained using top **20 selected features**

- **Dataset**:
  - Multi-class classification with **12 attack classes**
